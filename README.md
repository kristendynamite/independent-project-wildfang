# Wildfang Independent Project
### A page that showcases a product for the brand Wildfang and offers product information and a gallery
## Created on 5.27.17 by Kristen McKee

## Description:
#### This page showcases a product for sale, includes a list of product features, a product image that contains an absolutely positioned element, a table for product sizing, and a gallery of smaller related images. Floats, pseudo-elements, selectors, and various other CSS classes are used.

## Set Up & Installation:
* Visit the following link: <https://kristendynamite.github.io/independent-project-wildfang/>

OR you can:

* Clone this directory onto your Desktop
* Open the file folder and double click on 'index.html'

## Bugs:
There are no known bugs at this time.

## Wishlist:
Elements on right-hand-side of screen need to be centered within their portion of the screen. I want to apply an effect that changes the main product image when a user hovers or clicks on it to an image that shows another angle of the product. 

## Support:
